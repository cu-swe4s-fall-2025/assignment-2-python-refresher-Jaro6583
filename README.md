# python-refresher

The my_utils.py file contains the get_column function. That function reads in a data file (preferably a csv), then parses it as specified by the user.
The print_fires.py file is designed to be executed from a command line. Argparse has been used to make the inputs easy to control. Execute "python print_fires.py -h" to pull up the argparse help page for that file.
The run.sh file calls the print_fires.py file three times. The first time, it gathers the forest fire data from the USA. The next two times, it tries to call the print_fires.py file but makes mistakes.
